class User < ApplicationRecord
    has_secure_password
    # Provides user authentication features on the model
    # it's called in. Requires a column named `password_digest`
    # and the gem `bcrypt`

    # - It will add two attribute accessors for `password`
    #   and `password_confirmation`
    # - It will add a presence validation for the `password`
    #   field.
    # - It will save passwords assigned to `.password`
    #   using bcrypt to hash and store it in the
    #   the `password_digest` column meaning that we'll
    #   never store plain text passwords.
    # - It will add a method named `authenticate` to verify
    #   a user's pasword. If called with the correct password,
    #   it will return the user. Otherwise, it will return `false`

    # - The attr accesssor `password_confirmation` is optional.
    #   If it is present, a validation will verify that it is
    #   identical to the `password` accessor.
