  # When deleting a record that dependent
  # associations (i.e. many answers),
  # the foreign_key constraint in our db
  # will prevent it from being deleted until
  # all the dependent records have also been
  # deleted.

  # Set the option `dependent: :destroy` to have
  # all associated records be destroyed before
  # the record itself.

  # `dependent: :nullify` will cause all associated
  # answers to have their question_id column be set to
  # NULL before the question is destroyed.
  has_many :answers, dependent: :destroy

  # `has_many :answers` adds the following instance
  # methods to the Question model:

  # answers
  # answers<<(object, ...)
  # answers.delete(object, ...)
  # answers.destroy(object, ...)
  # answers=(objects)
  # answer_ids
  # answer_ids=(ids)
  # answers.clear
  # answers.empty?
  # answers.size
  # answers.find(...)
  # answers.where(...)
  # answers.exists?(...)
  # answers.build(attributes = {}, ...)
  # answers.create(attributes = {})
  # answers.create!(attributes = {})
  # answers.reload

  # `validates` is a method provided by
  # the parent class `ApplicationRecord` that
  # can be used to enforce rules on the data
  # that is saved in our database.

  # - The first arguments(s) are column names
  # - The last arguments are key->value arguments
  #   describing the rules to enforce

  validates(:title, presence: true, uniqueness: true)

  # - presence rule means that the title must exist
  # - uniqueness rule means that all questions must have
  #   different titles

  # When a model fails a validation, you can check
  # the errors by using the .errors method.
  # For more readable error messages, use .errors.full_messages.

    # We can create custom validations. Use the `validate`
    # method instead of `validates`. `validate` takes symbol
    # that correspond to a method name.
