class WelcomeController < ApplicationController

    # we call methods inside controller classes: actions
    # so here we have the `index` action
    def index
        # by default (convetion) actions will render view files
        # within a folder that matches the controller name
        # so it will look into the folder called app/views/welcome
        # the view file name should match the action name
        # it will also include the `format` and `templating systenm`
        # so the full file name will be something like
        # action.format.templating_system
        # so if the format is `html` and the templating system is `erb` the file name will be:
        # index.html.erb    
    end
