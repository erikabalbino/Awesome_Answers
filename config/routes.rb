  # /admin/...

    # The `namespace` method takes a symbol as a first argument
    # and a block. It will prefix the symbol's name to the
    # path of all routes defined inside the block.
    # GET /admin/dashboard
    
    resources :dashboard, only: [:index]

    # It will expect that the controllers for the routes
    # inside block to be contained in a module named after
    # the symbol.
    # Example: Admin::DashboardController

    # It will also expect the controllers to be in a sub-directory
    # named after the symbol.
    # Example: /app/controllers/admin/dashboard_controller.rb

    # GET /admin/users
    # POST /admin/users
    # GET /admin/users/:id
    # resources :users
  end

  # `resource` is singular instead of `resources`.
  # Unlike `resources`, `resource` will create routes
  # that do CRUD operation on only one thing. There
  # will be no index routes and no route will
  # have a `:id` wild card. When using a singular resource,
  # the controller must still be plural.

  # /questions/:question_id/answers
  resources :questions do
    # get :my_route
    resources :answers, only: [:create, :destroy]
  end

  # The above method call `resources :questions`
  # will exactly create all RESTful routes as written below:

  #Routes for QuestionsController
  # get "/questions/new", to: "questions#new", as: :new_question
  # post "/questions", to: "questions#create", as: :questions
  # get "/questions/:id", to: "questions#show", as: :question
  # get "/questions", to: "questions#index"
  # get "/questions/:id/edit", to: "questions#edit", as: :edit_question
  # patch "/questions/:id", to: "questions#update"
  # put "/questions/:id", to: "questions#update"
  # delete "/questions/:id", to: "questions#destroy"

  # we map HTTP verb/url combo to a controller#action 
  # (action is a method inside the controller class)

  get('/', {to: 'welcome#index', as: 'home'})

  get('/contact', {to: 'contact#index'})

  post('/contact_submit', {to: 'contact#create'})
